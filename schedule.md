# Schedule

TABConf is 100% open source - even the schedule!  

We’ve built a live, prettified version of the schedule that pulls directly from our GitHub project board. You can explore it here:

For those who want to see how the schedule is being managed and built in real time, the GitHub project board is the **source of truth**:

### Submissions and Updates

We’re very close to the conference date! While we’re still accepting submissions for talks, panels, workshops, and builder day projects, the schedule is now **largely saturated**.  
New additions may be limited as we finalize the event lineup.

If you still wish to propose something, please submit your idea here:  
[**Propose via GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/TABConf/7.tabconf.com/issues)

If your proposal doesn’t require changes to the main schedule - for example, a **side event** or **community activity** - we’re much more likely to include it.
